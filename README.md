## Development with Eclipse IDE

For further development of this add-on, the following tool-chain is recommended:
- Eclipse IDE
- m2e wtp plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- Vaadin Eclipse plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- JRebel Eclipse plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- Chrome browser

### Importing project

Choose File > Import... > Existing Maven Projects

Note that Eclipse may give "Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration" errors for pom.xml. Use "Permanently mark goal resources in pom.xml as ignored in Eclipse build" quick-fix to mark these errors as permanently ignored in your project. Do not worry, the project still works fine.

### Debugging server-side

If you have not already compiled the widgetset, do it now by running clean and package Maven targets for valo-toggle-button-root project.

If you have a JRebel license, it makes on the fly code changes faster. Just add JRebel nature to your valo-toggle-button-demo project by clicking project with right mouse button and choosing JRebel > Add JRebel Nature

To debug project and make code modifications on the fly in the server-side, right-click the valo-toggle-button-demo project and choose Debug As > Debug on Server. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/valo-toggle-button-demo/ to see the application.

### Debugging client-side

The most common way of debugging and making changes to the client-side code is superdev mode. To enable it, uncomment devModeRedirectEnabled line from the end of DemoWidgetSet.gwt.xml located under valo-toggle-button-demo resources folder and compile the widgetset once by running vaadin:compile Maven target for valo-toggle-button-demo. Refresh valo-toggle-button-demo project resources by right clicking the project and choosing Refresh. Click "Create SuperDevMode Launch" button on the Vaadin tab of the valo-toggle-button-demo project properties panel to create superder mode code server launch configuration and modify the class path as instructed above. After starting the code server by running SuperDevMode launch as Java application, you can navigate to http://localhost:8080/valo-toggle-button-demo/?superdevmode. Now all code changes you do to your client side will get compiled as soon as you reload the web page. You can also access Java-sources and set breakpoints inside Chrome if you enable source maps from inspector settings.
